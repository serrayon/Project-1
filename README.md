scroll through the existing db or add a author from around the world.

One side has author info second has comments and adds comments.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, Heroku to launch 

Changes made to project:

First page lets you log in or creat profile

We wanted a more comprehensive list with more information but we cut it down 
drastically in an effort to get a MVP deployed on time.  We accomplished adding 
comments and the functionality to eddit the comments.

Changes for future updates:  This serves as a initial data base that could be built out
cataloging writters from around the world.  In an effort to further expand the users knowledge 
of wirtters from different parts of the world. A bio section for each author along
with a expanded list of other books, articles, awards that they recieved.
